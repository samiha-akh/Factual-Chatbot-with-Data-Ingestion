We argue that the presented approach addresses one of the most dangerously, still most commonly, missed pieces in public and private discourses on sustainability.",

We tested the approach for some examples of supports that are currently receiving much attention: the sustainable development goals, planetary boundaries, circular economy, and sciencebased targets. We argue that the tested approach can be generalized and makes it possible to clarify limitations and value of any support from a systemic, systematic, and strategic sustainability perspective and, therefore, also to clarify how the supports relate to each other and can be selected and used in an effective and coordinated way. This is similar to how an operative system of, say, a smartphone, facilitates an effective and coordinated use of apps.

However, it is challenging to make direct effective use of macrolevel supports like the above in organizations (e.g., Ranängen et al. 2018). These supports have not been designed for organizations. The goals, boundaries, and targets are not set at the organizational level and no concrete procedural support is included for how to systematically and strategically relate organizational goals, action plans, and indicators to these macrolevel supports.

For example, the PBC could be used to assist a systemic understanding as a basis for the organization's visioning work (A), to provide a list of problem areas to cross read against in the organization's problem assessment to readily get currently important problem areas on the table (B), and, most prominently, to support innovations (C) and prioritizations (D) of the organization's practices based on the severity of problems as clarified by the colorcoded current status (see the diagram in Figure 2), including the speed of change of the variables in relation to the respective boundary. By acting on root causes of unsustainability, that is, eliminating the organization's contribution to society's violation of the SPs of the FSSD, the organization contributes to halting the increase of the problems in the problem areas included in the PBC (and other sustainability problems). This way it could be clarified and communicated how actions at the micro level contribute to solving the macrolevel problems highlighted in the PBC.",

    "answer": "There are many reviews and overviews in the literature of the sustainability supports used as examples in this study. To our knowledge, there is no previous attempt at a SWOT analysis of those supports using the SSDinformed lens we have used here.

However, to our knowledge, there is no previous attempt at a SWOT analysis of those supports using the SSDinformed lens we have used here (as provided by the extracted and combined features of the FSSD presented in Section 2). In relation to previous FSSDinformed studies of sustainability supports (e.g., Holmberg et al. 1999; Robèrt et al. 2002; Korhonen 2004; MacDonald 2005; Robèrt, Broman, and Basile 2013; D' Amato and Korhonen 2021), the current study takes off more from the perspective of the operational ABCD procedure and provides more explicit guidance (as a generalized approach) for analyses as well as for effective and coordinated use of sustainability supports in practice in organizations. The current study is special in relation to previous FSSDinformed studies also because it reviews some new examples of sustainability supports having significant influence in the current sustainability discourse. Thus, the current study provides novelty in relation to reviews and overviews where the FSSD has not been used and in relation to previous FSSDinformed studies of sustainability supports.",
